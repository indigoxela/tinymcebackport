# TinyMCE backport

Integrates the most recent and supported [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/)
 as alternative WYSIWYG editor for Drupal 7.

Fun fact: this is a backport from [Backdrop CMS](https://backdropcms.org/),
 not from Drupal 10.

It's a standalone module, unrelated to the existing, recently revived TinyMCE
 module, and also unrelated to the Wysiwyg module.

## Installation

The library (TinyMCE 6.8.x) ships with this module, no need for extra
downloads nor the libraries module.

- Install this module using the zipfile
- Disable CKEditor 4 on profiles for text formats on admin/config/content/ckeditor

If filtered_html is the text format you need the editor for, this module
should already do its job at that point.
If IMCE is installed, the image plugin will use that for picking inline
images. But IMCE is no dependency.

Note that there's absolutely no admin interface. All adaptions have to be
done via API in code. See tinymcebackport.api.php for some basic examples.

## Maintenance

Currently this is more like a proof of concept module. Fully functional, but
without any admin UI (the maintainer doesn't need any ;-) ).
Forking is possible â€“ just go for it.

## Credits

Bundles the versatile [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) JavaScript library
(MIT licensed), maintained with <3 by Tiny Technologies Inc. The editor has
been around for almost two decades and is one of the most used Open Source
JavaScript based WYSIWYG editors, integrated in many projects.
